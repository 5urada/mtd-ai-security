# AI-Enhanced Moving Target Defense: Attack and Defense Optimization

This repository contains research on applying artificial intelligence to Moving Target Defense (MTD) systems, exploring optimization strategies for both attackers and defenders in dynamic network environments.

## Overview

Moving Target Defense systems dynamically reconfigure network parameters to disrupt adversarial activities. This research investigates whether AI provides greater advantages to attackers or defenders.

## Research Objectives

- **Defense Optimization**: Develop AI-driven MTD systems that intelligently adapt reconfiguration strategies
- **Attack Analysis**: Evaluate how AI-powered tools can overcome MTD constraints
- **Comparative Assessment**: Determine whether AI favors attackers or defenders in MTD environments
- **Strategic Frameworks**: Create game-theoretic models for optimal MTD investment

## Collaboration

This research is conducted at Texas A&M University in collaboration with the [SUCCESS Lab](https://success.cse.tamu.edu/).
