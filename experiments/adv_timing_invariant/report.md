**Date:** August 12, 2025  
**Experiment Duration:** Phase 1: Basic discovery (45 minutes), Phase 2: Formal validation (15 minutes)

## Abstract

This research presents a formal mathematical framework for discovering persistent invariants in Moving Target Defense (MTD) systems and provides empirical validation through controlled experiments. We demonstrate that timing-based characteristics enable target re-identification with 87.5% accuracy despite IP address shuffling, revealing a fundamental vulnerability in current MTD implementations. Our analysis introduces a stability index S(φ) for quantitative invariant assessment and uncovers a critical gap between theoretical stability metrics and practical attack feasibility.

## 1. Introduction

Moving Target Defense (MTD) systems dynamically reconfigure network parameters to disrupt adversarial activities. IP address shuffling, a prevalent MTD technique, periodically reassigns virtual addresses to real targets, theoretically preventing persistent target tracking. However, the fundamental question remains: **do underlying infrastructure characteristics create measurable invariants that survive MTD reconfigurations?**

This research addresses the critical need for formal evaluation frameworks for MTD effectiveness. We develop a mathematical model for invariant discovery and apply it to timing-based reconnaissance attacks, revealing significant vulnerabilities in address-based MTD systems.

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 Formal Problem Definition

**Entities:** Real targets indexed by i ∈ {1, 2, ..., N}  
**Epochs:** MTD reconfiguration periods indexed by t ∈ {1, 2, ..., T}  
**Observations:** Measurements X_{i,t} for entity i at epoch t  
**Feature Functions:** φ such that φ(X_{i,t}) extracts invariant characteristics

**Objective:** Find feature functions φ where φ(X_{i,t}) is stable within entities but separable between entities across MTD reconfigurations.

### 2.2 Stability Index Definition

We define the stability index S(φ) as:

```
S(φ) = min_{i≠j} D(P^φ_{i,·}, P^φ_{j,·}) / max_i max_{t≠t'} D(P^φ_{i,t}, P^φ_{i,t'})
```

Where:
- **P^φ_{i,·}** represents the distribution of feature φ for entity i across all epochs
- **D()** is a distance metric between distributions or values  
- **Numerator:** Inter-entity separability (minimum distance between different entities)
- **Denominator:** Intra-entity variability (maximum variation within any entity)

**Interpretation:**
- S(φ) > 1.0 indicates potential invariant existence
- Higher values suggest stronger entity separability
- S(φ) ≤ 1.0 suggests no meaningful invariant patterns

### 2.3 Attack Model

**Assumption:** Adversaries can observe network responses during MTD operations but cannot directly access virtual-to-real IP mappings.

**Attack Goal:** Classify virtual IP observations to real target entities with accuracy significantly above random chance (33.3% for 3 targets).

## 3. Experimental Design

### 3.1 Environment Configuration

**Platform:** CloudLab Utah cluster, 5-node testbed  
**MTD Implementation:** Custom Python controller with iptables NAT translation  
**Network Topology:** 1 controller, 1 attacker, 3 differentiated targets  
**Address Space:** Virtual IPs 10.10.1.20-49, Real IPs 10.10.1.3-5  
**Rotation Policy:** 30-second IP shuffling intervals

### 3.2 Target Differentiation

To simulate realistic infrastructure diversity:

- **Target A (10.10.1.3):** Modified TCP buffer settings (`net.core.rmem_max = 16777216`)
- **Target B (10.10.1.4):** Artificial network delay (`tc netem delay 2ms`)
- **Target C (10.10.1.5):** Default system configuration

### 3.3 Data Collection Methodology

**Timing Measurement Protocol:**
- ICMP ping with multiple packet sizes (64B, 256B, 512B)
- Parallel virtual IP discovery (1-2 second sweep)
- Rapid measurement cycles (20-25 seconds per epoch)
- Synchronization with MTD rotation intervals

**Collection Parameters:**
- Duration: 15 minutes continuous operation
- Measurement frequency: Every 25 seconds
- Target coverage: All active virtual IPs per epoch

### 3.4 Corrected Analysis Approach

**Critical Methodological Correction:** Initial analysis incorrectly treated virtual IPs as entities. The corrected approach properly defines:

- **Entities = Real target IPs** (actual infrastructure)
- **Observations = Virtual IP measurements** attributed to real targets
- **Analysis Unit = Real target timing distributions** across epochs

This correction ensures meaningful stability index calculation and proper invariant assessment.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Data Collection Summary

**Collection Metrics:**
- Total measurements: 291 successful responses
- Failed measurements: 33 (11.0% failure rate)
- MTD epochs observed: 32
- Virtual-to-real IP mappings: Successfully reconstructed for all epochs

### 4.2 Target Timing Characteristics

**Per-Target Analysis:**

| Real Target | Configuration | Epochs | Mean Response | Std Deviation | Timing Range |
|-------------|---------------|--------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| 10.10.1.3 | Modified TCP | 32 | 4.016ms | 0.096ms | 3.85-4.20ms |
| 10.10.1.4 | Network Delay | 32 | 6.166ms | 0.238ms | 5.65-6.70ms |
| 10.10.1.5 | Default Config | 32 | 3.884ms | 0.060ms | 3.75-4.05ms |

**Key Observations:**
- Clear timing hierarchy: Target B > Target A > Target C
- Low intra-target variation (σ < 0.25ms for all targets)
- Consistent separation maintained across all epochs

### 4.3 Formal Stability Index Analysis

**Stability Index Calculation:**
- **S(φ) = 0.5526**
- **Inter-target separability:** 0.1313ms (minimum pairwise distance)
- **Intra-target variability:** 0.2375ms (maximum within-target variation)

**Mathematical Framework Validation:**
The formal implementation confirms the stability index calculation, providing quantitative assessment of timing invariant strength.

### 4.4 Attack Performance Evaluation

**Target Classification Results:**
- **Overall accuracy:** 87.5% (84/96 correct classifications)
- **Random baseline:** 33.3% (3-target scenario)
- **Improvement over random:** 163% relative increase

**Confusion Matrix Analysis:**
Classification performance demonstrated consistent target identification across MTD epochs, with misclassifications primarily between Targets A and C (closest timing values).

### 4.5 Critical Research Finding

**The Stability-Accuracy Paradox:** Despite a relatively low stability index (S(φ) = 0.553), attack accuracy reached 87.5%. This reveals a fundamental disconnect between mathematical stability metrics and practical attack feasibility.

**Analysis of the Paradox:**
- Mathematical stability focuses on absolute separation relative to internal variation
- Attack feasibility depends on statistical detectability of consistent patterns
- Small but persistent differences (0.131ms) enable high-accuracy classification with sufficient sampling

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Mathematical Framework Contributions

**Stability Index Validation:** The formal S(φ) calculation provides the first quantitative framework for MTD invariant assessment, enabling systematic comparison of different invariant types and MTD policies.

**Methodological Correction Impact:** Proper entity definition (real targets vs. virtual addresses) fundamentally alters stability calculations, highlighting the importance of correct mathematical modeling in security analysis.

### 5.2 MTD Vulnerability Assessment

**Infrastructure Diversity Impact:** Realistic target differentiation creates detectable timing signatures that persist across address shuffling operations. This suggests that production MTD systems with heterogeneous infrastructure face similar vulnerabilities.

**Attack Feasibility Analysis:** High classification accuracy (87.5%) demonstrates practical attack viability despite low mathematical stability, indicating that formal metrics may underestimate real-world vulnerabilities.

### 5.3 Stability-Accuracy Disconnect

**Critical Insight:** The observed paradox between low stability index and high attack success reveals limitations in current MTD evaluation frameworks. Traditional stability metrics may provide false security assurance when statistical attack methods can exploit small but consistent differences.

**Implications for MTD Design:** Defense systems should consider both mathematical stability and statistical detectability when assessing invariant risks.

### 5.4 Limitations and Scope

**Experimental Constraints:**
- Controlled laboratory environment with known target configurations
- Limited to timing-based analysis using ICMP protocols
- Single MTD policy type (IP address shuffling)
- Manual virtual-to-real IP mapping reconstruction

**Generalizability:** Results likely extend to production environments where infrastructure diversity typically exceeds experimental conditions, potentially creating stronger timing signatures.
